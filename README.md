  * all required fields need to validated, if left empty, should let user know (PS! at least one field should be required)
  
### Example

1. Idea is to create messenger application, users can send and recieve messages. There is also a history of messages.
2. 4 fields in the created web page can be :from, :to, :message, date_to_recieve:. Required are :from, :to and :message.

MY IDEA 
Users can set a meeting point and time and there is going to be a countdown to the set time. At the end of the countdown, the users will receive an e-mail.
Users will input an item that they will provide the other person with if they are late.
