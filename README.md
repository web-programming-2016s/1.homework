Idea.
I am more interested in web design. As we know to make good design, you should be very flexible.
If we are talking about programming aspects. Then my idea is to make special form for users in order to get User generated content.
It can be applicable for different topics (design, content for projects, feedbacks). 
If possible try to make system, which will scan similar ideas and pick the most popular.
